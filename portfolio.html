The class I took was Intro into programming it was a very challenging class but I learned a lot from it. Since then I have been expanding my skills with taking other classes and teaching myself AngularJS and other programming languages.  <p> <br>
        Some of my hobbies that I enjoy doing is gamming I have played video games since I was young. My favorite video game ATM is Hearthstone but I am big Resident Evil Fan (S.T.A.R.S.). Other hobbies I have are snowboarding, going to the gym, NBA (Miami Heat fan), and horror movies. I am big fan of horror movies my favorite horror movie has to be Halloween but there is so many good ones.
